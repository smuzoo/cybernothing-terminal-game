# CI/CD Fix Summary

## Problem
The build was failing in CI/CD with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

This is a known npm bug with optional dependencies.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Package.json Updates
- Added explicit Rollup dependencies
- Added optional dependencies section
- Added clean scripts for Windows and Unix

### 2. Vite Configuration
- Excluded problematic Rollup dependencies from optimization
- Added server configuration

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Updated to install Rollup dependencies explicitly
- Added environment variables for proper build
- Used modern GitHub Pages deployment approach

### 4. Build Scripts
- Created `build.sh` for Unix systems
- Created `build.ps1` for Windows PowerShell
- Added troubleshooting documentation

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.js` - Added optimization exclusions
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated CI/CD workflow
- `BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Documentation
- `build.sh` - Unix build script
- `build.ps1` - Windows build script

## Testing
✅ Local build works on Windows
✅ Dependencies install correctly
✅ Rollup native modules are available

The CI/CD should now work reliably across all platforms.
