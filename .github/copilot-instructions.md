This project is a browser-based JavaScript reimplementation of a terminal/psychological game originally written in Python (cybernothing2.py). All interactive, text, and meta features should be ported to the web using modern JS, HTML, and CSS. Use browser APIs or placeholders for system/user info. All effects (glitch, typewriter, etc.) and command logic must be preserved.
